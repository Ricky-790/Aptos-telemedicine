# 🏥 Telemedicine Billing on Aptos Blockchain

## 📘 Project Description

This project is a decentralized billing system for telemedicine consultations built on the Aptos blockchain. It leverages smart contracts to enable secure, transparent, and automated healthcare billing using Aptos Coin (APT). Patients can register billing records and pay for medical consultations, while healthcare providers receive payments directly on-chain.

The system is built with a Python backend (FastAPI) and a modern single-page frontend using React.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Our vision is to empower healthcare systems with blockchain-based automation to:

- Ensure **secure and immutable** patient billing data.
- Facilitate **instant and trustless** payments to providers.
- Minimize administrative overhead and eliminate intermediaries.
- Make telemedicine more accessible with seamless digital interactions.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 📄 Add receipts with on-chain event logs.
- 🧾 Support for dynamic pricing or multiple consultation types.
- 📊 Patient dashboards showing payment history and health stats.
- 🌍 Integration with decentralized identity (DID) for patient verification.
- 💡 Use zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving billing.
